# Depth-Estimation
This is a Matlab implementation of our ICME 2018 paper "Xinpeng Huang, Ping An, Liang Shan, Ran Ma, and Liquan Shen, View Synthesis for Light Field Coding Using Depth Estimation, in 2018 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), 2018, pp. 1-6.".Using this program, the depth maps of the dense sub-aperture images can be estimated.
In the program, "depth_estimation.m" is the main program.
Additionally, we will further update this implementation in the future.
