# Depth-Estimation
This is a Matlab implementation of our ICME 2018 paper "View Synthesis for Light Field Coding using Depth Estimation".Using this program, the depth maps of the dense sub-aperture images can be estimated.
In the program, "depth_estimation.m" is the main program.
Additionally, we will further update this implementation in the future.
